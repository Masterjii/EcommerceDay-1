## Principles

The project follows the following software development principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
   - The codebase adheres to the DRY principle, minimizing redundancy and promoting code reusability. Repeated logic or functionality is consolidated to avoid duplication.

2. **SOC (Separation of Concerns):**
   - The application design follows the SOC principle by dividing the code into distinct modules or components, each handling a specific concern. This separation enhances maintainability and readability.
